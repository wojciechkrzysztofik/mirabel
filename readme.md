# Mirabel - html, css & js

To run development mode, go to console/terminal and run this command:

```javascript
gulp
```

All your css and js changes will be watched and compiled on the fly.

There is no "build" command or task so everything what you need to do is copy css, js, image and font files to prod directory.

I put the latest prod version to dist directory.
